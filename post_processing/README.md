# Pylbo

Pylbo (**Py**thon for **L**egolas **B**inary **O**utput) is the post-processing framework that we developed specifically for Legolas code. Pylbo's goal is to make all Legolas data directly accessible and to provide quick on-the-spot analysis of results without the need to write a small script to plot your data.

Note that Pylbo's visualisation capabilities are meant for fast data inspections, and not to produce publication-worthy figures. For that you should use your own piece of code, in which you can use Pylbo to access all Legolas data directly.

For a full list of package requirements and installation instructions you can take a look at the Legolas website.

### Formatting
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Pylbo uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for code formatting and style, which are both explicitly checked in the CI tests.
